    This is a demo pipeline that does some simple file operations
    ## create file
    ## append text to the file
    ## delete file
    ## delete file again
    this will fail because file doesn't exist
spec:
  steps:
    - ./steps/create-file.yaml
    - ./steps/append-text.yaml
    - ./steps/delete-file.yaml
    - ./steps/delete-file.yaml
